## Introduction



## Update Log

* Version 1 - 2023 Apr 25
   * Snapshot 2023 Apr 25 after MIT meeting
* Version 2 - 2023 Apr 25
   * Adding switch to do charged gen particles or all gen particles

* (non-version update) - 2023 May 31
   * Now we consolidate settings into a settings file.  Do `make Prepare` to prepare the settings database.  Do `DHQuery Setting.dh PPSignalMC Nominal` to see the settings for PP signal MC for example.

   * Adding branches for Z weight systematics (muon tag and probe)
* Version 15b - 2023 Jun 25
   * Nothing changed here, except that background mode is not recommended anymore.  Please use 20230625 code for background mixing.
* Version 15c - 2023 Jun 27
   * Adding different types of track selection (loose/tight)
* Version 16 - 2023 Jun 29
